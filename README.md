1. API Interaction:
[x] Write a python script to interact with the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Implement error handling and comply with the API's rate limits.
2. Data Extraction:
[x] Extract weather forecast data at regular intervals.
- Handle potential connectivity issues or API downtimes.
[x] Note: a few (10-20) api calls is fine here and be sure to stay well within the free tier of the api key.
3. Data Transformation:
[x] Transform the JSON data into a format suitable for database storage.
[x] Include necessary data cleaning and normalization steps.
4. Database Design:
- Design a schema for the PostgreSQL database to store the weather data.
- Consider appropriate data types, indexes, and constraints for the schema.
5. ETL Process:
[x] Outline an ETL process that integrates extraction, transformation, and loading steps.
[x] How would you orchestrate the workflow? Please outline the tech stack you would use.
[x] Ensure the process is scalable and maintainable.
6. Logging and Monitoring:
[x] Outline logging for tracking the pipeline's operations.
- Set up basic monitoring and alerts for the pipeline.
7. Testing:
- What unit tests for critical components of the pipeline would you consider?
- Note any testing strategies or frameworks utilized.
8. Deliverables:
[x] Source code for the data pipeline.
- Database schema (ERD).
[x] Code can be in either notebook or script format.
- Outlines and documentation should be in a short presentation.
9. Evaluation Criteria:
- Code quality and clarity.
- Efficiency and scalability of the solution.
- Adherence to best practices in data engineering.
